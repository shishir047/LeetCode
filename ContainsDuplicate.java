My main objective to pursue a Master’s in Computer Science is to achieve deeper insights into Machine learning while strengthening my programming and analytical skills. I have been previously working as a Software Engineer for the past seven years, with four years of
undergraduate experience in Raj Kumar Goel Institute of Technology, Abdul Kalam Technical University, and 2 years of work experience at Sopra Steria. 
As part of my final year project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the number of cases of seasonal diseases, like swine flu and dengue fever, in rural areas of Haryana (the state among the highest recorded cases of dengue in India). This project additionally helped me determine the worth of Machine Learning.  I wanted to use my ML skills to unravel various technical issues that massive firms face. Thus, I joined Sopra Steria in June 2019 as a Software Engineer through the campus placements. At Sopra Steria, I joined
the Core Promotions Infrastructure team that works for clients like Gucci and Nike. As one of the projects, I targeted increasing the engagement rate of shoppers by developing a system that gives promotions. We created a system to spot how much promotion value can facilitate bringing back completely different user groups. Sopra Steria has a team of machine learning engineers and data scientists that work on classifying users into totally different classes of potential paid users based on the collection of signals such as credit card, last purchase, and site. As a part of the infra team, I collected these signals, and I ran them through different pipelines. The project results were astonishing; we inflated the engagement rate by a whopping 15% for a few user teams. This service is currently being used actively.
Due to my work on machinearning in Sopra Steria, I was recently invited by my university’s dean to convey a lecture to students on the “Impact of Machine Learning”.  Till now, my experience has been very exciting. These experiences have helped me understand the core elements of machine learning; but, I want to further hone my ML and Analytical skills to resolve bigger issues. Therefore, I want to join the Michigan Technological University to pursue an MS in Computer Science and Machine Learning. After my graduation, I want to work on the complicated issues faced by huge marketplace firms as I find them to be very intriguing. 
I believe that studying algorithms courses taught by professor Timothy C. Havens will help me dive deep into ML and can better equip me to resolve bigger and difficult issues in prediction and classification. Also, the analysis work was carried out by professor Timothy C. Havens in “Machine Learning” is very exciting and I am looking forward to working with him if given a chance. I am sure that I will be able to not only get pleasure from my stay at the Michigan Technological University however also grow professionally and personally.
